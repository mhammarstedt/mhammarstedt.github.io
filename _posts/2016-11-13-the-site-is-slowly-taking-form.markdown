It appears the site is finally taking form. And imagine my surprise -- it is actually turning out quite the way I
wanted it to! I still have some final adjustments to make, and a lot of that concerns the exact place that you are
looking at right now -- the blog section.

I have yet to decide how I will solve the blog post header issue without adding CSS-style to the HTML-document. How
I will work my way around that remains to be seen. I am not entirely pleased with my blog page containing all my blog
posts listed either. Funny thing is, I can't point out exactly what it is that bothers me with it. Thankfully I have
a few more days to figure things out and decide how I want everything to look.

Other than that, I will of course have to proof-read all the material on the website. As of now, everything has just
been scrabbled down. Oh well. Deadline is not until this Friday. Plenty of time!
