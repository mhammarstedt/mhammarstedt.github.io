So here we are. As it happens, I think we just might be standing at the finish line for now. It is time to open up the
gates to the website and take a step inside.

People say that time flies by, and that could not have been more true. Deadline is still not in two more days,
but I believe I have done all I can for the website for the time being. There is no point in overworking it, and
for now I am pleased with the result, considering the amount of time I have been working on it. I hope to still
be making a few updates in the future, improvements here and there. But then again, are you ever finished unless
you want to be? Things can always be better, fancier, faster... You name it. At some point you just have to put
your foot down and decide that enough is enough... Until the next update or layout change.

Well, now when I think about it, perhaps you never are finished with a project after all.
