Hello smartphone users! Allow me to present the latest addition to my website -- mobile optimization.

In today's multitechnological society, it would only be foolish to ignore such an important aspect as mobile
optimization. Frankly, I believe that a great deal of the people who will enter this website might be doing so on
their smartphones. And to give them the next to impossible task of having to find their way around a website
that is not optimized for their specific screen size... That wouldn't be very polite of me at all!

And therefore, I introduce to you my latest update -- a mobile optimized website. For now, perhaps not a perfect one.
But somewhere to start at the very least. After all, I need to have something to keep working on, do I not?
