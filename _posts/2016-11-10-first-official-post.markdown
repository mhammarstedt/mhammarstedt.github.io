This is my first official post on my new jekyll website, which is of course just a part of the
vital process of testing the website while building it up.

Therefore, I will keep this short and simply include it to be able to adjust the way blog post are being
displayed on the website. But nevertheless, this is the first blog post. That is surely worth some celebration!
