### My journey to becoming a web programmer

Truth be told, of all the things I thought I would come to work with when "I grew up", being a web programmer certainly
wasn't one of them. Although, I will say that I have always been somewhat of a computer nerd. In my early teen years
I fist got acquainted with HTML and web programming, and that in the easiest way possible. Already at this point,
I found the process of designing and customizing your own web site (in this case only in small proportions) exciting.
From then, my interest for media and design followed me through high school, studying a broad program with focus on
media and advertisement on the side.

I have always been an early learner and user of Photoshop, enjoyed photographing and editing my pictures as close to
perfection as my skills would allow them to be. In this environment I would go as far as calling myself more than just
an amateur. In general, photographing has always been a hobby of mine, and was just one of the many classes I took
in high school for that exact reason.

It was also at this point I took my first class in web design (as the class was called). Working with what I have 
been now, this was really just a beginner's class with not too high standards. Nevertheless, it once again reminded
me of the fun of web programming and that it might not be so bad after all.

After high school, it took me two years to find the exact program I wanted to study at University. And in those two 
years I can ensure you that my mind constantly went back and fourth between several programs. I even applied to one or two,
just to turn them down later on. The only thing I knew for sure was that I wanted to study something media-related.
And media is such a large area! From the beginning I would have guessed to end up with a design-focused program, but
things can surely take a turn.

It was winter 2015 that I decided to take two courses at Linneaus University for spring 2016. Both courses were distance
courses with no required attendance. Since I had always loved the idea of being able to study and "have a life" at the
same time, studying at a distance was something I thought would fit me perfectly. I had always been a hard-working
student with high discipline, but of course, I had never studied at a university before. Therefore, trying it out 
with a few courses seemed like a good way to go. I also made sure to choose two courses in web programming to also
see if that was something I would actually enjoy working with. And who would have thought - web programming and 
studying at a distance fit me like a glove!

So then it was decided. Web programming at a distance. While I did search the web, looking at other universities as
well, I had enjoyed my spring courses at Linneaus University and saw no reason for not continuing my studies there.
Hence, I ended up where I am today, studying the Web Programmer program at Linneaus University in Kalmar.

### Personal

So why studying at a distance, some might wonder. While it is too far to drive to Kalmar every day from just outside
of Ljungby, a move to Kalmar would not have been too far and has also been considered. However, studying at a distance
not only allows me to work at the same time, but also lets me spend time my favorite hobby - my dogs!

Apart from work and the studies, my greatest interest is my two dogs. Both of them are still very young, my oldest 
currently 2.5 years and my youngest only 10 weeks old. Although, training and competing is a big interest of mine.
I will not bore you with the details of the different ways we are competing, just know that I am a very active dog
owner with two active dogs of working breed. As of this year I am also active and a part of the board at the local 
dog club and with after New Years be managing their website and most computer-related matters.
